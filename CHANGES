Temporary, post-Paramiko changelog while we get our sh!t together.

## ssh 1.7.15 (2012-MM-DD)

* Ported over https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/pull/63. Thanks to Dwayne
  Litzenberger for catch & patch.
* #32: Raise a more useful error explaining which `known_hosts` key line was
  problematic, when encountering `binascii` issues decoding known host keys.
  Thanks to `@thomasvs` for catch & patch.
* #33: Bring `ssh_config` parsing more in line with OpenSSH spec, re: order of
  setting overrides by `Host` specifiers. Specifically, the overrides now go by
  file order instead of automatically sorting by `Host` value length. In
  addition, the first value found per config key (e.g. `Port`, `User` etc)
  wins, instead of the last. Thanks to Jan Brauer for the contribution.

## ssh 1.7.14 (2012-05-07)

* #15: Implemented parameter substitution in SSHConfig, matching the
  implementation of `ssh_config(5)`. Thanks to Olle Lundberg for the patch.
* #24: Switch some internal type checking to use `isinstance` to help prevent
  problems with client libraries using subclasses of builtin types. Thanks to
  Alex Morega for the patch.
* [Fabric #562](https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/562): Agent forwarding
  would error out (with `Authentication response too long`) or freeze, when more
  than one remote connection to the local agent was active at the same time.
  This has been fixed. Thanks to Steven McDonald for assisting in
  troubleshooting/patching, and to GitHub user `@lynxis` for providing the
  final version of the patch.

## ssh 1.7.13 (2012-02-13)

* #5: Moved a `fcntl` import closer to where it's used to help avoid
  `ImportError` problems on Windows platforms. Thanks to Jason Coombs for the
  catch + suggested fix.
* #4: Updated implementation of WinPageant integration to work on 64-bit
  Windows. Thanks again to Jason Coombs for the patch.

## ssh 1.7.12 (2012-02-10)

* Added an IO loop sleep() call to avoid needless CPU usage when agent
  forwarding is in use.


## ssh 1.7.11 (2011-11-18)

* Handful of internal tweaks to version number storage.


## ssh 1.7.10 (2011-11-17)

* Updated `setup.py` with `==dev` install URL for `pip` users.


## ssh 1.7.9 (2011-11-08)

* Updated `setup.py` to account for packaging problems in PyCrypto 2.4.0


## ssh 1.7.8 (2011-10-24)

* Initial fork of Paramiko 1.7.7.1
* Renamed package to 'ssh'
* Added an extra `atfork()` call to help prevent spurious RNG errors when
  running under high parallel (multiprocess) load.
