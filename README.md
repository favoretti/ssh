# ssh

The `ssh` library is a fork of, and spiritual successor to, the
[Paramiko](http://www.lag.net/paramiko/) Python SSH library. It was created by
the developers of the [Fabric](http://fabfile.org) library as a way to ensure
timely updates and bugfixes for critical issues.

`ssh` is currently in a transitional state and other than a rename and a
handful of small but crucial fixes/tweaks, the code and the documentation
remain unchanged from the original.

We hope to clean up the presentation and documentation in the near future, as
more bugfixes and API additions are rolled out. We also plan to absorb some of
the higher profile bugs/issues from the Paramiko Github repository.

Thank you for your patience!
